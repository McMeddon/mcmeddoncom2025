| How long did it take to make these map?s  | Roundabout:	Gathering the experience: ca since 2020 / ca 5000h+ <br> Working on this project: mostly a full week <br> Exporting the world: 1h for each export <br> Building, fixing, improving, and adding customized small bits: 3-10x <br> Building assets and working on node structures, 4 days <br> Rendering: 15-20 Images = 1-2 Days  | 
| Did you make those assets? |  Yes, every asset is done by myself. |
| For 1.18+ Maps, are Copper Ores and Deepslate included?  |  Yes |
| Is it made for survival?  |  Yes with 100% survival in mind |
|  Java - Do animals spawn?	 | Yes, worlds are populated with plants, animals, and nature blocks. Also Mobspawners with animals are scattered around the world.  |
| Bedrock - Do animals spawn?  |  Animals are definitely spawning regularly independent from the terrain (in my experience) |
| For 1.18+ Maps, are Crystal Geodes included?  | 	Yes across the map are sparsely scattered.  |
| For 1.18+ Maps, are Copper Ores and Deepslate included? | 	Yes, near 0-20 will begin a full layer of deepslate with all ores, Copper Ore is available underground everywhere  |
| What are your plans with these maps? | These are adventure maps, survival maps, and creative maps for you to build, play and explore. For my part, I gain new techniques and experience with every new map, building on that for the next and making map by map better maps.  |
| Do you do commissions? | Checkout https://mcmeddon.com/commissions to see if im available or ask on the Discord  |
| PMC Member: "[...] Out of curiosity, if someone else uses your world to build things in and wanted to share, do you just request a credit?"	 | Yes always - please credit the origins of work / the creator. (people want to know where to find the stuff) <br><br>         Redistributing or selling my Intellectual Property without consent is not allowed. <br><br>         Showcase Submissions are allowed <br><br>         (Backside info: I've spent hundreds of hours to achieve the knowledge to create those maps. And can spend days creating each Map. For the casual people: I encourage you to play..test and build on these maps. I actually like to see what you can do on/with them. I see my maps as canvases for people to explore and enjoy... what I don't like it when people just plainly say: I made that canvas, that's mine. [â€‹analogy end] It's IP theft, disrespectful, and ungodly frustrating to deal with. And there are either Kids who just entered the internet and don't know better and there are 3rd Parties that do that intentionally)  |
| Where is the map center/spawn?  | 2k Maps - 1024,1024 <br> 3k Maps - 1536,1536<br> 4k Maps - 2048,2048<br> 5k Maps - 2560,2560<br> 6k Maps - 3072,3072<br> 7k Maps - 3584,3584<br> 8k Maps - 4096,4096<br>  |
| Are there versions without structures?  |  No, but the source files are available, with which you can remove structures and reexport the pure map (Explanation: Online Storage Space is my main concern) |
| Where are villages?	In all the recent maps, Villages are placed near rivers.  |     Tips:     <br>- On PMC you can find often a overview map.     <br>- You can also import the map into WorldPainter and export a image/overview map from there.  |
|  Can i continue playing your map after the subscription has ended? | Yes ofc, every map youÂ´ve downloaded until the subscription end is on your pc, where you have full control over the map  |
| Map recommendations?  | 	Checkout maps with a "ðŸŒŸ" or icons, these are my recommended ones  |
| Bedrock: IÂ´ve Spawned in water/vanilla area where's the map/spawn?  | 	YouÂ´ve spawned at 0,0, the top-left edge, at the map edge. Head towards ~ 2000,2000 for the map center. <br>  <br>  (Explanation: This is program caused issue, as during the conversion the spawn point gets reset to 0,0. And while sometimes the area around seems vanilla, that's the pregenerated area i had to create in order to insert/convert the map into.)  |
